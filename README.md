The Ride-Sharing Management System is a comprehensive C++ program that simulates the operations of a ride-sharing platform. It provides two main functionalities: User and Admin operations.

User Functionality:
Sign-Up & Login: New users can sign up by providing their personal information, such as name, age, gender, and phone number. Existing users can log in using their credentials (name and phone number).

Ride Booking: Once logged in, users can input their pickup and drop-off locations. The system searches for available drivers in the vicinity and displays driver details. Users can choose a driver to book the ride, with the fare calculated based on distance.

Ride History: Each ride's details are stored, including the route, fare, and other transaction information, allowing users to view their ride history.

Admin Functionality:
Driver Management: Admins can add new drivers to the system, including their personal and vehicle details, such as name, age, car model, color, and phone number. Admins can also delete drivers if necessary.

Driver Information: Admins can view a list of all registered drivers along with their details and current status.

User History: Admins can view the history of all users, including their ride details, payments, and locations.

Features:
Password-protected Admin Section: Only authorized personnel can access the admin section via a password.

Dynamic Data Handling: The system allows the dynamic addition and management of both users and drivers, with easy data retrieval.

Fare Calculation: The fare for each ride is automatically calculated based on the distance in kilometers, with a rate of 12 units per kilometer.

Interactive UI: The system uses a text-based interface with clear prompts and responses, making it easy to navigate for both users and admins.

This program is ideal for understanding the basics of object-oriented programming in C++, with features such as inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic data structures.
